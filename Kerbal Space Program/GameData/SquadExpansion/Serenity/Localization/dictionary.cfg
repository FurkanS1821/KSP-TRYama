		#autoLOC_6011013 = Return this to have it analyzed and gain all information about it.
		#autoLOC_6011014 = Al <<1>>
		#autoLOC_6011015 = If our experts are correct, this is one of the oldest trees on the planet… perhaps as old as Professor von Kerman himself.
		#autoLOC_6011016 = A ring sample of this ancient tree will provide centuries of valuable historical climate data. But can it be gathered without harming the elder Baobab?
		#autoLOC_6011017 = While there are other trees on Kerbin, these are by far the most interesting.They stand out so much its like you can barely see the others sometimes.
		#autoLOC_6011018 = Glistening like a mirror, this massive crystal formation provides valuable information, if Bob will stop looking at his reflection long enough to gather it.
		#autoLOC_6011019 = These quartz formations are still something of a mystery. Some of our scientists are pondering how such a massive structure could have formed here. Others are wondering if they picked the right career and shouldn't have been jewelers instead.
		#autoLOC_6011020 = These quartz formations only show up in the more difficult to reach areas of Kerbin. Are they shy? Or did something happen in the past to the more accessible ones?
		#autoLOC_6011021 = This strange formation seems almost weathered, which is uttery impossible on a low gravity body. Further study may provide vital clues.
		#autoLOC_6011022 = Scattered far and wide across the surface of Ike, these strange meteorites hint at an extermely violent early history of both Duna and Ike.
		#autoLOC_6011023 = Besides providing valuable data of Ike & Duna's pre-history, pet "Ike-Rocks" are now all the rage back home on Kerbin.
		#autoLOC_6011024 = It is curious how such a pile could accumulate on a low gravity moon. Further analysis could provide valuable insite on Bop's origin's, and whether it's a natural or captured moon.
		#autoLOC_6011025 = The huge rock spires of Pol already defy all logic. Perhaps if we can learn how these particular fragments broke apart, we can also discover how they were able to form at all?
		#autoLOC_6011026 = These small fragments appear to be made of the same material as Pol's huge rock spires. But what could have broken them off? Krakens?
		#autoLOC_6011027 = All evidence points towards Minmus once having several liquid oceans, physics indicates this is impossible! Study of these strange small stones will provide valuable insight into this mystery.
		#autoLOC_6011028 = It's going to be really hard to convince the folks back home that these aren't actually mint flavored sugar cookies.
		#autoLOC_6011029 = An olivine formation jutting out from a salt flat… on a low gravity moon with no atmosphere? More impossible evidence that Minmus may have once had… oceans???
		#autoLOC_6011030 = This huge formation will provide scores of valuable data. But more important to the guys at the lab, in this low gravity, can you reach the top in one leap?
		#autoLOC_6011031 = As strange as it sounds, these stones look more like smooth river-rocks than meteorite fragments. Further analysis will prove valuable.
		#autoLOC_6011032 = If Minmus is made of mint ice-cream, we could use these small brown stones as the chocolate sprinkles - if we were willing to take them there. Do we have the delta-v for a detour?
		#autoLOC_6011033 = Strangely enough, this cooled magma resembles layers of delicious hot fudge.
		#autoLOC_6011034 = Now cooled, this wonderful magma flow has an almost organic look to it.
		#autoLOC_6011035 = Incredably lightweight for its size, one wonders if this pumice like stone can actually float in Eve's weird pinkish oceans.
		#autoLOC_6011036 = Similar to volcanic glass found on Kerbin, analysis of this facinating sample should glean valuable information into Eve's volcanic past.
		#autoLOC_6011037 = Formations like this one are rare on Kerbin. Some of our scientists theorize that Eve's more violent past has something to do with their formation.
		#autoLOC_6011038 = Whichever scientist first looked at these large dome shaped formations and thought 'This reminds me of breakfast' likely won a prize of some sort.
		#autoLOC_6011039 = This Duna stone is much like every other stone we've seen on Duna. But now that you've found it, it's taken on special significance and will go down in the history of Kerbal spacefaring. Also may sell well in an auction house.
		#autoLOC_6011040 = Duna's thin atmosphere does little to stop these meteorites from crashing into it and scattering over its surface. While we did come to Duna to study the planet itself, why not stop to sample composition of another celestial body as well?
		#autoLOC_6011041 = Duna's thin winds carry this fine sand in huge storms, leaving these dunes behind in deposits all over the planet. Amazing for scientists - terrible to try to get out of your bathing suit though.
		#autoLOC_6011042 = How these formed is still a mystery to scientists back on Kerbin. Do they have any relationship to the pancake domes on Eve, or is that just a galactic and gastronomical mystery we have yet to solve. Who knows where we may find an elusive 'syrup' sample.
		#autoLOC_6011043 = Dres is in ideal solar position to get struck repeatedly by asteroids whose orbit is perturbed by Jool's influence. It's almost like Jool has a plan for its smaller neighbor
		#autoLOC_6011044 = When these smaller craters of Dres formed they didn't kick up nearly as much material as the larger ones, which makes studying them a different sort of scientific opportunity. Also, a great place to nap where Wernher can't see you.
		#autoLOC_6011045 = These greyish, plain stones may not look like much to the naked eye, but we've seen our scientists literally salivating at the thought of examing one.
		#autoLOC_6011046 = What secrets hide in these ordinary looking Mun stones? Careful anaylsis will help us understand the secret of Kerbin's orgins. Less rigorous analysis tells us that they hurt when you hit your toe with one.
		#autoLOC_6011047 = Kerbals have been staring at the craters of the Mun for untold generations, but never from such a close distance. Then again, this crater is much smaller than the ones we've been looking at, so it should all balance out.
		#autoLOC_6011048 = Is anyone up for a round of cosmic golf? Once the Mun is fully explored, these craters may make for amazing tourist destinations.
		#autoLOC_6011049 = These large Mun craters present a navigation challenge for rovers. Careful examination shows no ill intent, however.
		#autoLOC_6011050 = These large craters are barely visible with the best telescopes we have on Kerbin. Now that we've finally examined them up close, we've determined that yes, the Mun is as full of holes as we expected.
		#autoLOC_6011051 = Laythe stone is very similar to the types we see on Kerbin. Strangely, those similarities actually seem to excite our scientists about the possiblities. They really need to get out more.
		#autoLOC_6011052 = This rock is the first we've found away from Kerbin that might make a good napping spot.
		#autoLOC_6011053 = Timing the eruptions of Laythe's geysers has shown that their irregularity is regular.
		#autoLOC_6011054 = Vall's crust is made up of these volatile ice chunks. Unfortunately, project 'Vall Smoothies' has not been approved as a line of research for further testing.
		#autoLOC_6011055 = These stones cropping up in Vall's frozen crust remind us of sprinkles on a ball of ice cream.
		#autoLOC_6011056 = One of the most amazing sights in the entire solar system, cryovolcanos sound like an oxymoron. Actually they're an amazing feature only possible when elements we normally only encounter as a gas freeze on a planets surface.
		#autoLOC_6011057 = Careful examination helps us finally determine why this type of Tylo stone comes in only brighter shades.
		#autoLOC_6011058 = Now we can finally determine why this type of Tylo stone comes in only darker shades. Does Tylo itself have multiple personalities to generate such distinct rock colors?
		#autoLOC_6011059 = This formation is clearly a place where Tylo's different stone factions have come together in peace and unity to... have some sort of party. We think. There's definitely mingling going on.
		#autoLOC_6011060 = Eeloo's distance from the Sun means that nearly anything will freeze here. When our scientists see this chunk of ice we've found they may not be as impressed as we hope.
		#autoLOC_6011061 = This brown boulder may look ordinary, but reaching it is one of the most impressive feats of Kerbal engineering. Consider examining it a major achievement... even if only geologists can tell it apart from a brownish boulder back on Kerbin.
		#autoLOC_6011062 = These impressive bergs form due to tectonic activity on Eeloo... or is it oceanic? They are really impressive and I'm sure our scientists will have a vigorous discussion to sort out the nomenclature.

		#autoLOC_8004338 = This boulder shows evidence of extensive hydrological action, it's lovely and smooth.

		#autoLOC_8004344 = A dark colored stone, showing one of two common mineral colors that make up Tylo's crust. Many Kerbals wonder where the strawberry ones are.
		#autoLOC_8004345 = This outcropping with patterns of light and dark on it looks natural. Is it, or is it really some alien plaything? Which begs the question - are we all just playthings of some vast, incomprehensible alien minds?\n\nNo that can't be.
