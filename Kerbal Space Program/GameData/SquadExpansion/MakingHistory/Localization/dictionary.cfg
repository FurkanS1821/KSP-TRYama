OK, what about this: you'll need to <b><i>EVA and use your suit's RCS thrusters to reach full Munar orbit and then try to complete your rendezvous with the orbiter</b></i>!\n\nIf you want to make it home alive, you'll need to time this maneuver perfectly.

		#autoLOC_8300002 = For each Mission you can see the Mission Briefing. You can also save your Missions during play to return to them at a later time. For each Mission you complete you may see, where applicable, a score to impress your friends with.
		#autoLOC_8300003 = At the bottom of the Missions list there are 3 Tutorial Missions for you to try - each will teach you a different aspect of the Mission Builder!
		#autoLOC_8300010 = Beginner Tutorial
		#autoLOC_8300011 = Welcome to the Mission Builder.\n\nThis is where you plan out and export your Missions for others to play.
		#autoLOC_8300012 = Once a Node is placed you can tweak and fine tune its settings by altering its properties in the top section of the Action Pane, located on the right side of the screen.
		#autoLOC_8300013 = Before we begin we need to set up the Start Node.\n\nThis will dictate where the player starts, what the starting settings are for your mission as well as any other Mission Critical Information.
		#autoLOC_8300014 = To start with let's tell the player where they need to start and what their vessel conditions are.\n\nThere are many options here but let's keep it simple for now and start them at the KSC in their own vessel.
		#autoLOC_8300015 = All new Missions appear with two Nodes by default, the Start Node and a Spawn Vessel Node.\n\nNow click on the Spawn Vessel Node and notice there is a Name for our vessel called 'Unnamed Vessel'.\n\nClick this name now and type a new name for the vessel.
		#autoLOC_8300016 = You will notice there are two radio buttons settings in the Settings Action Pane. One sets this vessel as Player Built and the other set this vessel as Creator Defined.\n\nPlayer built vessels are built by the mission player, whereas creator built vessels you (as the mission creator) must build for the player to use during mission play.
		#autoLOC_8300017 = You will also note the other settings for the Vessel.\n\nThe Situation is used to set the starting situation for the vessel. This could be at a Launch Site, Landed or in Orbit. The default is Launch Site.\n\nLet's leave our vessel set to this for now.
		#autoLOC_8300018 = The next setting is the facility that will be used to build the vessel. This can be the VAB or SPH.\n\nThe default is the VAB. Let's leave our player created vessel set to this for now.
		#autoLOC_8300019 = The last setting we are going to cover here is the Launch Site selection.\n\nHere you can choose where the vessel will be Launched from when the situation is set to the Launch Site setting.\n\nFor now we will leave this set to the LaunchPad which is located at the KSC.
		#autoLOC_8300020 = Please ensure the Vessel is set to Launch from the LaunchPad and the facility is set to the VAB before we can continue.
		#autoLOC_8300021 = Great! Now the player will start their mission at the KSC LaunchPad in a vessel they will build themselves.\n\nYou can also choose to start players of your missions in Orbit, landed, or a number of other different scenarios.
		#autoLOC_8300022 = Now we need to give the Player something to do - let's get them to orbit the Mun!\n\nGo to the Sidebar on the left side of the screen and find the Node that says 'Orbit' and drag it out onto the Canvas near the Start Node - you can find it under the 'Location' category.
		#autoLOC_8300023 = Find the Orbit Node first, locate it and drag it out onto the Canvas.
		#autoLOC_8300024 = Fantastic job!\n\nNow we need to set the planet to be orbited and also a target orbit.
		#autoLOC_8300025 = Make sure the planet to Orbit is set to the Mun.
		#autoLOC_8300026 = Please select the Mun to continue.
		#autoLOC_8300027 = Great!\n\nWe'll leave the orbital settings at their default for now, but you can see that there are lots of options available to you for setting target orbits.\n\nYou can even change them visually in the Graphical Action Pane (GAP) underneath the Settings.
		#autoLOC_8300028 = The next thing we need to do is link the Start Node to the Orbit Node.\n\nClick the output connector on the Start Node (on the right side of the node). Once you have clicked a connector line will appear and follow the mouse pointer.\n\nClick on the input connector on the Orbit Node.
		#autoLOC_8300029 = Let's add one final goal to this mission. Let's direct the player to land on the Mun to wrap up the Mission.\n\nDrag out a Landed Vessel Node and place it near the Orbit Node.
		#autoLOC_8300030 = Find the Landed Vessel Node first, locate it and drag it out onto the Canvas.
		#autoLOC_8300031 = Now select the Mun from the celestial body dropdown list in the Node's Settings.
		#autoLOC_8300032 = Try selecting the Mun from the dropdown list in the settings of the Landed Vessel Node.
		#autoLOC_8300033 = By default all Landed Vessel Nodes will choose the whole celestial body as the target location.\n\nYou can be more specific though and choose Biomes or actual coordinates for the player to land on by changing the location type setting.
		#autoLOC_8300034 = Now link the Orbit Node to the Landed Vessel Node in the same way we linked the Start Node to the Orbit node to wrap up this section of the Mission.
		#autoLOC_8300035 = Lastly let's save our work, otherwise we can't play our mission, or share our creation with the rest of the community.\n\nOnce saved we can load them up to play or come back here to edit them further.
		#autoLOC_8300036 = Click on the Save button.
		#autoLOC_8300037 = Try saving your Mission - click on the highlighted button to continue.
		#autoLOC_8300038 = Ah yes of course, we need to provide a Mission Briefing first!
		#autoLOC_8300039 = Type a Name for your mission in the box at the very top of the dialog and then enter in a line or two in the Mission Briefing notes - this will tell players of your mission what to expect, then select OK when you're done.\n\nYou can also review your objectives, validate your mission and add scoring and awards to it.
		#autoLOC_8300040 = Great! Those are the basics on how to create a Mission.\n\nThere's still much more to show you so you can now either choose to continue the tutorial (and learn the Action Pane, Events, and more) or Exit back to the Missions Menu.
		#autoLOC_8300041 = Creating Missions is quite simple, all you need to do is drag Nodes out from the Sidebar (on the left) onto the Canvas in the middle of the screen.

		#autoLOC_8400510 = Welcome back! We've already done so much, but a few more little touches and this Mission will be talked about for years to come.
		#autoLOC_8400511 = Let's put in some requirements for the Crew that will be taking us on to greatness.
		#autoLOC_8400512 = Click on the Spawn Vessel Node that is docked to the Start Node.
		#autoLOC_8400513 = Scroll down to the bottom of the list in the SAP and click the Add button. In the dropdown choose Crew.
		#autoLOC_8400514 = Select the Add button and then select Crew.
		#autoLOC_8400515 = Now we don't want anyone getting lonely up there so let's put a requirement for two Kerbals on the Vessel.\n\nClick the dropdown next to Operator and select Equal. Then either click on the box and type 2 or move the slider until the number says 2.
		#autoLOC_8400516 = Make sure the Operator is set to Equal and the Crew count is 2.
		#autoLOC_8400517 = There are a lot of options open to you as the Mission Creator, and also the Players, for assigning Crew and creating your own custom Crewmembers to be used in your missions.
		#autoLOC_8400518 = We are almost there, now we just need to add in a required part: the Mystery Goo Containment Unit. Players of the Mission won't realize they need it until the Event triggers, and it would be a bit unfair to let them get all that way and not help them with the equipment they will need!
		#autoLOC_8400519 = Go to the Spawn Vessel node and scroll down to the Required Parts parameter in the Settings. Click anywhere on the Required Parts line to open up the GAP.
		#autoLOC_8400520 = Make sure you are selecting Required Parts.
		#autoLOC_8400521 = Great! Now scroll down to the Science category and select it, then find the Mystery Goo Containment Unit and click that to select it. It will turn blue when you do.
		#autoLOC_8400522 = Select the Science category then select the Mystery Goo Containment Unit.
		#autoLOC_8400523 = It's always wise to put some success and failure messages in your Missions. These messages can add a lot of flavor.
		#autoLOC_8400524 = Let's start with the failure message. Drag out a Vessel Destroyed Node from the Vessel category and put it anywhere on the canvas.
		#autoLOC_8400525 = Drag out a Vessel Destroyed Node to continue.
		#autoLOC_8400526 = Let's point the Vessel Destroyed Node in the direction of the player's Vessel. With the Node selected, select the desired vessel from the dropdown list under the Vessel Destroyed subheading.
		#autoLOC_8400527 = Try selecting the Vessel name from the dropdown list.
		#autoLOC_8400528 = Ok, now let's assign a Message to it. Drag out a Dialog Message from the Utility Category.
		#autoLOC_8400529 = Place a Dialog Message Node near the Vessel Destroyed Node.
		#autoLOC_8400530 = Give a suitable message to be shown. This message will be shown if the player of your mission manages to destroy their Vessel.
		#autoLOC_8400531 = Give a suitable failure message by clicking in the message portion of the Dialog Message Node.
		#autoLOC_8400532 = Fantastic! You should now have a good level of understanding on how it all works. Try making your own Missions and seeing what you can create. Good luck and have fun!
		#autoLOC_8400533 = Now link the Vessel Destroyed Node to the Dialog Message Node.
		#autoLOC_8400534 = Link the Vessel Destroyed and Message Nodes together.
		#autoLOC_8400535 = Let's now set up the success criteria. Drag out two more Dialog Message Nodes and put one of them next to the Landed Vessel Kerbin Node. Put the other next to the Landed Vessel Mun Node.
		#autoLOC_8400536 = Put two Dialog Message Nodes on the canvas near the two Landed Vessel Nodes.
		#autoLOC_8400537 = Link one of Dialog nodes with Landed Vessel Kerbin and the other Dialog node with Landed Vessel Mun.
		#autoLOC_8400538 = Link the Message Nodes with the Landed Vessel Nodes.
		#autoLOC_8400539 = Give each Message Node a suitable message. Remember players will see this when they have won the Mission so remember to give them a good pat on the back!
		#autoLOC_8400540 = Remember to give an awesome well done message to your player!
		#autoLOC_8400541 = Try selecting the Vessel name from the dropdown list.
		#autoLOC_8400542 = Let's point the Vessel Destroyed Node in the direction of the player's Vessel. With the Node selected, select the Vessel name you created from the dropdown list under the Vessel Destroyed subheading.
		#autoLOC_8400543 = Give a suitable message to be shown. This message will play if the player of your mission manages to destroy their Vessel.
		#autoLOC_8400544 = Give a suitable failure message by clicking in the message portion of the Dialog Message Node.
		#autoLOC_8400545 = You may have seen that the nodes have a red glow around them and there is a red report button at the top of the Canvas. This is because the game is flagging a Validation Error.
		#autoLOC_8400546 = Where there are errors they will be flagged and called out. Missions with errors can't be exported, but can be saved.
		#autoLOC_8400547 = To see what the errors are, click on the red report icon at the top of the Canvas.
		#autoLOC_8400548 = Click on the red validation button at the top of the Canvas.
		#autoLOC_8400549 = This is the Validation dialog. Here you can see that we are being warned that there are no nodes marked as end nodes. We should mark the messages as End Nodes to fix this.
		#autoLOC_8400550 = Close the dialog and click each of the three Dialog Message Nodes and tick the "Set as End Node" box in each.
		#autoLOC_8400551 = Mark the Dialog Messages as End Nodes in the Settings.
		#autoLOC_8400552 = OK, the last thing we need to do is export the Mission. This will package everything up into a single file that can then be uploaded and shared with the entire world!
		#autoLOC_8400553 = Click the highlighted Mission Briefing button to open up the Briefing dialog for your Mission.
		#autoLOC_8400554 = Click the highlighted button to open the Briefing dialog for your Mission.
		#autoLOC_8400555 = Here you can review the Mission Briefing text, the Objectives, and any scoring or awards assigned to the Mission.
		#autoLOC_8400556 = You can also enter details of any Mods that the player must have installed to play the mission, assign your Mission to a Pack, and set its difficulty so players know exactly what they are getting into!
		#autoLOC_8400557 = Finally you can assign Banners to be shown when the player looks at your Mission Briefing or when they win or fail the Mission.
		#autoLOC_8400558 = Great readings - we can either carry on with the mission and land on the mun or you can come home, it's your choice!
		#autoLOC_8400559 = Missing description for Advanced Tutorial.
		#autoLOC_9990010 = Intermediate Tutorial
		#autoLOC_9990011 = Welcome back!\n\nWe'll use this tutorial to build on what we learnt in the last one and start introducing some more advanced techniques!
		#autoLOC_9990012 = Let's make a change and get the Player to land at a specific point on the Mun.\n\nSelect the Landed Vessel node and select Biome from Location Type dropdown list.
		#autoLOC_9990013 = Select Biome from the Location Type dropdown list
		#autoLOC_9990014 = We'll use the Graphical Action Pane at the bottom of the Action Pane to select a Biome.\n\nControls are identical to the Tracking Station. You can zoom in and out with the Mousewheel, select a different Planet with a click of the Left Mouse Button on the arrows on either side of the planet name.\n\nYou can also tumble around planets by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse.
		#autoLOC_9990015 = You will see that as you move your cursor around any applicable Biomes they will be highlighted.\n\nClick on any Biome to select it.
		#autoLOC_9990016 = Use the Action Pane to select a Biome on Mun.
		#autoLOC_9990017 = Ok, now we're going to add an Event to mix things up a bit.\n\nEvents are situations that change the course of a Mission. Events aren't exposed to the player in the Mission Briefing until they are activated.\n\nEvents can be used to surprise a player with an unforeseen and possibly catastrophic development!
		#autoLOC_9990018 = For our Mission we'll do something simple, but there are all sorts of catastrophic and helpful options open to you as a Mission Creator.
		#autoLOC_9990019 = Find the Science Experiment Node and put it between the Orbit Mun and the Landed Vessel nodes.
		#autoLOC_9990020 = Try dragging out the "Science Experiment" Node from the Resources and Science category
		#autoLOC_9990021 = Let's link the Science Experiment node between the Orbit Node and the Land Node.\n\nYou'll need to first delete the existing connecting line and then reconnect the nodes - click on the connecting line to select it then hit the delete key.
		#autoLOC_9990022 = Try linking the Science Experiment between the Orbit and Land Nodes.
		#autoLOC_9990023 = If you have an Event Node connected to something with other Nodes coming off of it the Event Node path will always take precedence.
		#autoLOC_9990024 = Go into the Settings for the Science Experiment Node and tick the Event Node box.
		#autoLOC_9990025 = Tick the Event Node box to continue
		#autoLOC_9990026 = Let's tell the player we've had some anomalous readings from a High Munar orbit and we need them to check it out before they come back home.
		#autoLOC_9990027 = Drag out a Dialog Message Node and connect it between the Orbit and Science Experiment Nodes in the same way we created the Science Experiment Node. This will play the message once we have completed the Orbit node.\n\nDon't forget to delete the existing connecting line.
		#autoLOC_9990028 = Try linking the Dialog message between the Orbit and Science Experiment Nodes.
		#autoLOC_9990029 = Click on the Dialog Message node and in the Settings type "We've had some odd readings from high above the Mun". Please increase your orbit and see what the Mystery Goo tells us!"
		#autoLOC_9990030 = Write a message to explain to players what is going on.
		#autoLOC_9990031 = Let's go ahead and set up the Settings for the Event Node.
		#autoLOC_9990032 = Under the Experiment heading in the Science Experiment Node select Mystery Goo™ Observation. In Situation choose Flying High and in Celestial Body select The Mun. Leave the other settings on their defaults.
		#autoLOC_9990033 = Select Mystery Goo Observation for the experiment. In Situation choose Flying High and in Celestial Body select The Mun
		#autoLOC_9990034 = Lets now give the player a choice of what to do next, branching paths are a great way to introduce an element of choice into the players game.
		#autoLOC_9990035 = Let's tell them that once they've observed the Mystery Goo they can either come home or Land on the Mun.
		#autoLOC_9990036 = Place another Dialog Message Node on the Canvas - put this one after the Science Experiment node and link it to the Landed Vessel Node.\n\nDon't forget to delete the existing connecting line.
		#autoLOC_9990037 = Try linking the Dialog message between the Science Experiement Node and the Landed Vessel Node.
		#autoLOC_9990038 = Nearly there - add in a Message that explains that they can either land on the Mun or choose to come home.\n\nWe'll add the missing Node to the Mission in a moment.
		#autoLOC_9990039 = Write a message to explain to players what is going on.
		#autoLOC_9990040 = Great! Now drag out another Landed Vessel Node from the Location category and link it to the Dialog Message Node you've just placed.
		#autoLOC_9990041 = Drag out a Landed Vessel Node and link it to the Dialog Message Node.
		#autoLOC_9990042 = Great! Now select Kerbin from the list of Celestial Bodies.
		#autoLOC_9990043 = Select Kerbin from the Settings for the node
		#autoLOC_9990044 = One other thing you can do with your Mission is to provide a score for it - this will allow players to gauge how good they are at your Mission compared to other players.
		#autoLOC_9990045 = Let's set a score which gives the player a bonus if they complete the Science Objective before a set time has passed!
		#autoLOC_9990046 = Drag out a Time Since Node from the Utility Category and position it under the Science Experiment Node
		#autoLOC_9990047 = Drag out a Time Since Node from the Utility Category
		#autoLOC_9990048 = Let's set the time that they need to do this to 1 day - that should be plenty of time to readjust their Orbit.
		#autoLOC_9990049 = Click the Time Since Node and select Science Experiment from the dropdown. Then select Less Than for the Operator and set the time to 1 Day by clicking in the Day box and entering 1.
		#autoLOC_9990050 = Set the Node dropdown to Science Experiment, the Operator to Less Than, and the time to 1 Day.
		#autoLOC_9990051 = Fantastic! Now find the Change Score node from the Currency and Score Category and place it near the Time Since Node.
		#autoLOC_9990052 = Drag out an Change Score node from the Currency and Score Category
		#autoLOC_9990053 = Now click on the Change Score node. Type in an amount to give the player in the box next to Bonus Score.\n\nThis will award the player those points if they manage to complete the Science node in under 1 Day in Game Time.
		#autoLOC_9990054 = Add in the box next to Bonus Score any amount of points to continue.
		#autoLOC_9990055 = The last thing we need to do to finish with the scoring is to link everything up.
		#autoLOC_9990056 = Drag out a link from the Science Node to the Time Since Node.\n\nThen drag one from the Time Since Node to the Change Score node.\n\nLastly drag a line from Change Score to the Dialog Message Node to complete the loop.
		#autoLOC_9990057 = Link the Science Node to the Time Since Node, then a link from that to the Change Score node, and finally from the Change Score to the Dialog Message Node.
		#autoLOC_9990058 = We've learnt a lot about how Events can change the course of a mission so let's leave it there for the moment.\n\nThere's one more Tutorial to go which should then give you everything you need to create your own Missions and make a piece of your own history. \n\nDon't forget to save your progress!
